t3import_export
===============

Imports data from different sources into TYPO3 and exports from TYPO3 to different targets.
Possible data sources and targets are databases, and files (XML, CSV...).
Import and export tasks are described via TypoScript and can be grouped to sets.
Tasks can be executed manually via backend module or command line or automatically as a scheduler task.
